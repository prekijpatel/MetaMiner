MetaMiner is a desktop application built to streamline the retrieval, normalization, and exploration of prokaryotic genome metadata from NCBI-hosted genomes. It offers an intuitive, integrated interface that allows users to interactively filter, analyze, and visualize metadata from hundreds or even thousands of genomes with just a few clicks.
