MetaMiner is a desktop application built to streamline the retrieval, normalization, and exploration of prokaryotic genome metadata from NCBI-hosted genomes. The idea is to offer an interactive interface that allows users to filter, analyze, and visualize metadata from thousands of genomes with just a few clicks.
