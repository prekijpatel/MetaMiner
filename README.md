![graphical abstract](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8973c17-ea0c-4b87-9e9f-77c28993bd78)

MetaMiner is a desktop application built to streamline the retrieval, normalization, and exploration of prokaryotic genome metadata from NCBI-hosted genomes. The idea is to offer an initeractive interface that allows users to filter, analyze, and visualize metadata from thousands of genomes with just a few clicks.
